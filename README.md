Because of that I lose a lot of time, one task takes 10 times longer than it should. That is where **NowGoWork** is useful. This is a _one-html-file_ application which helps you to concentrate on your work – otherwise you will lose all the progress you have made! Once you open the file on browser you will be asked for a time limit and after that you will need to write anything without bigger pauses than you’ve chosen. When using it you are sure to work as effective as you are able and flexible choice of time allows you to work at your own pace.
